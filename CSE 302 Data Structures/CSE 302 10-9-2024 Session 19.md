## Recursion
- Recursive function: a function which divides work by calling itself
	- Direct: the function calls itself
	- Indirect: a series of function calls that start and end with the same function
		- `fn 1` $\rightarrow$ `fn 2` $\rightarrow$ `fn 3` $\rightarrow$ `fn 1`
#### Factorial Sequence with Recursion
- $n! = n \cdot (n-1)!$ if $n > 0$
- Base case: `n = 0`
- General (base) case: `n * (n-1)!` while $n > 0$

#### Pros of Recursion
- more manageable for debugging
	- no need to rewrite functions
- better readability
- divide and conquer problems

#### Cons of Recursion
- more memory used because it has to store previous function calls
	- this can lead to a possible stack overflow (hitting memory capacity)
- can lead to infinite recursion if base case is not declared
