## Microcontrollers
- A microcontroller is a IC used in a embedded system. 
- Instructions are executed to combine numbers, read ports, and send out data
- Instructions include add, subtract, moving, etc.
- Assembly language combines instructions with data from memory locations
- the Arithmetic Logic Unit (ALU) carries out math instructions
- **Data registers** contain the values of the variables, similar to RAM
- **Address registers** act like pointers
- **Status registers** keep track of special events like "carry" or "timer overflow" or "interrupt on pin 7"
- the program is kept in *program memory*. This memory is like a USB stick, it doesn't get dumped when the power goes off
